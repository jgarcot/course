#**Example**
```
    1. Implement a Lot class which prints to the console its lotNumber
```

In the bad example the **Single Responsibility Principle** tells us that this class is actually handling an extra responsibility, I mean, printing to the console.

**Every class should have a single responsibility. There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.**
